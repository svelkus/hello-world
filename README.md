just learning a little something new

I just recently moved back to Washington State after living in the MidWest for ten years. It is good to be back although I miss certain things about Minnesota, like the hockey and the people. Here in the PNW, people seem a to be non-commital or even selfish. There isn't as much community as there was in Minnesota.
